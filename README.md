# Python_Projects

For react apps, run npx create-react-app 'Project name' to create the framework directory.


#npm start
    Starts the development server.

#npm run build
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

#npm test
    Starts the test runner.

#npm run eject
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!

We suggest that you begin by typing:

  #cd front-end-app
  #npm start
